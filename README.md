# üéπ Chord Explorer

Hey there!

Welcome to my little side project: **Chord Explorer**.

---

## ‚ú® What This App Does

- Let you pick any key (major or minor)
- Show all the chords in that key:
    - Triads (with inversions)
    - Seventh chords
    - Extended and altered chords
- Share some of my favorite **Japanese progressions** ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Suggest which chords go well together
- Give you quick chord spellings if you‚Äôre writing or composing

All wrapped up in a colorful, simple web app.
